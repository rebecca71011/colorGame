# colorGame
This is a game based on the rgb color scheme. HTML, CSS and JS are used.
Every time the page is reoaded or 'new game' is selected, the colors displayed on the screen are randomized.
The player has to guess the right color by interpreting the rgb value that is displayed.
If the player guesses correctly, all the colors change into the color of the picked color.
There are two modes- Easy (Choose between 3 colors) and Hard (Choose between 6 colors)
